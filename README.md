A simple snake game built with Python and PyGame.

This requires the built in `time` and `random` module and `PyGame` which can be installed from [here](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)

Feel free to tinker the code and add features to it.

Happy Coding :rocket

A simple snake game built with Python to be played on the terminal.

This requires only the `random` and `curses` modules to be imported.

Feel free to tinker the code and let me know what you think about it


>**NOTE:-
If you are using windows and get a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_curses'` error, try installing the [windows-curses package](https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/)**
